MxSxC1 Moon

This is taken From Real Images Of The Earths Moon, and not very well converted, it will look blocky when used through telescope.

Moon Phases (Low Quality Version For Performance)

THIS IS ALPHA LOW QUALITY VERSION
1. New moon phases
2. Prototype of the spyglass scope used by [REMOVED] in "The Dark Is A Cold Lonely Shadow"

[SPOILER ALERT]

No spoilers in this pack, other than the theme and content itself is a potential spoiler (more like a clue).

However related packs and "MxSxC1 The Time Machine" definitely DOES contain spoilers for "The Dark Is A Cold Lonely Shadow - Book 1 - Raz'Kul"

Given book 1 isn't quite finished yet and most definitely not published, only a few have read it.

[MOON PHASES]

The phases of the moon are (in chronological order as they appear in-game) 

 Full moon
 Waning gibbous
 Last quarter
 Waning crescent
 New moon
 Waxing crescent
 First quarter
 Waxing gibbous


[THE TIME MACHINE]
Moon phases, time stop/speed up/time lapse/control/etc is done through "MxSxC1 - The Time Machine"

Note: Some Shaders will completely over-ride or ignore this, or can be set to do so.

It works in Vanilla, and with multiple popular shaders using Iris.

We don't do mods, mixins, or plugins...everything we do works within Mojang framework.
